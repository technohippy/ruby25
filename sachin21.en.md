# Ruby and Me
Congratulations on Ruby 25th anniversary.
I'm 22 years old from this year. and the Ruby is 3-year-senior.
I started using the Ruby when I'm a junior high school student. So Ruby and I have been together for 5-6 years.
I had a hard mental problem when I started studying time. but I feel better about myself when I am coding with Ruby. it seems like the tranquilizer.
my hard mental problem is improving with changing doctor at 2014. So I've got start work with Ruby at Tokyo.
The first few years, I couldn't self-reliance but I did self-reliance now.
I just want to say Ruby is changed my life.
It's thanks to Ruby. Thank you very much. (And sorry for my poor English)
